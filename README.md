# Covid-19 Data Analysis Using SQL
This is a SQL project that analyzes the COVID-19 data provided by Our World in Data. The data contains information on cases, deaths, and vaccinations for various countries around the world.

## Data Analysis

- Analyzed Covid-19 data using SQL, including calculating death rates and percentages of population infected and died
- Identified the country with the highest infection rate compared to population and the continent with the highest death count per population
- Joined and analyzed Covid-19 vaccination data, including calculating the number of people vaccinated per day and comparing vaccination rates to population size
- Conducted data analysis to inform decision-making and understand Covid-19 trends

## Explanation
I have analyzed Covid-19 data using SQL to calculate various metrics such as death rates, infection percentages, and vaccination rates. This data analysis was carried out with the objective of informing decision-making and gaining a better understanding of Covid-19 trends.

During my analysis, I identified countries and continents that have been most severely impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, based on the highest infection and death rates per population. Through this analysis, I was able to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the global impact of the pandemic.

Furthermore, I conducted an analysis specifically focused on Pakistan, in order to better understand the situation in this country. This included calculating the percentage of the population in Pakistan that has been infected with Covid-19, as well as analyzing Covid-19 vaccination data to determine the percentage of the population that has been vaccinated so far. Through this analysis, I was able to gain insights into the extent of the pandemic's impact in Pakistan, as well as the progress being made in terms of vaccination efforts.
